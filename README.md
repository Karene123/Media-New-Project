Media News Project

We seek to address the reason why people continue to frequently get their
news from social networking sites despite the fact that they do not trust it. We have
identified a few hypotheses that form the basis of our research question. Firstly, we will use
the survey findings to show the lack of trust that people who obtain news from social
media have towards family, friends, and news media in general. Additionally, we will show
that the respondents who read the news for political reasons tend to only focus on either
republican or democratic debates to enhance their political views. We also identify that
respondents who approach social media news with a skeptical eye are more likely to fact
check whatever they read on social platforms to verify its authenticity. Survey data also
indicates that readers who diversify their sources of information on the subject of
government and politics are more likely to engage and share their opinions with their
family and friends.
